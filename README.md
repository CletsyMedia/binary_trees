# Binary Tree Operations in C

Explore the fundamentals of binary tree data structures with our C-based group project. This collaborative effort delves into the implementation, manipulation, and traversal of binary trees using the C programming language. From basic tree creation to advanced operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching, our project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of binary trees and their applications in computer science.
